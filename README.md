# Study on procedural and dynamic meshes for faster game iteration

Hi! I'm **Miquel** and this is an open-source code created as part of my final degree project. This code aims to be a starting point for people that want to do some practical research about **procedural meshes and dynamic regeneration.** 

When running this project, you will find a **custom rendering engine** made with OpenGL and C++ and a dynamic mesh composed by **procedurally generated primitives.** When moving the settings on the right menu, you will find that the entire mesh reacts to the changes and **dynamically adapts** its shape to fit as desired. The research process is **better complemented with the written research,** which will be HERE once the official page is published and the research becomes open source.

To execute the project, just download the last release and double-click the "PDM-TFG.exe" file.

### Controls:
* **Hold right mouse** click and move the mouse to rotate around the mesh.
* **W, S:** Zoom in and out of the mesh
* **Scroll wheel:** Also zoom in and out of the mesh
* **F:** Focus back into the mesh
* **SPACE:** Take a screenshot
* **Left mouse:** Interact with menus and input fields.

Have fun!
